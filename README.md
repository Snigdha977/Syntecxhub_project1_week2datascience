Overview

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using Python.
It focuses on analyzing sales data over time and across product categories using appropriate chart types.

Objectives

Plot sales over time using line charts

Perform monthly and quarterly aggregation

Compare category-wise sales using bar charts

Visualize category share using pie charts

Save all charts as PNG files

Export a short textual summary

Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas

matplotlib

Project Workflow

Generate a synthetic sales dataset

Save the dataset as CSV and Excel files

Perform monthly and quarterly time-series aggregation

Create line, bar, and pie charts

Save visualizations in PNG format

Export a short project summary

Files Generated

sales_data.csv – generated dataset (CSV)

sales_data.xlsx – generated dataset (Excel)

monthly_sales.png – monthly sales trend

quarterly_sales.png – quarterly sales trend

category_sales_bar.png – category comparison

category_sales_pie.png – category-wise sales share

summary.txt – brief explanation of results

Chart Choices & Formatting

Line charts are used for time-series data to clearly show trends over time

Bar charts are used to compare sales across discrete categories

Pie charts are used to show proportional contribution of each category

Axis labels, rotated ticks, grid lines, and tight layout are used to improve readability and presentation

How to Run
python project1_time_series.py


All output files will be generated in the same directory.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates effective use of basic data visualization techniques to analyze time-based and categorical sales data, following standard analytical and reporting practices.
